## Beaglebone Code

This directory contains code and libraries developed for the Beaglebone Black and Pocketbeagle boards.

The first code I got running on the Beaglebone Black using the two PRU co-processors to handle the Lepton's VoSPI stream and display the image on a linuxfb device driving a ubiquitous ILI9341-based 320x240 pixel LCD display.
